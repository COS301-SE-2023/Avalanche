Each graph can be interacted with in isolation, and this does not affect the other graphs at all.

On a graph, there are 3 items that can be interacted with.

## Domain Watch
Domain watch is a feature that allows you to enter a domain and search for other similar domains in the relevant namespace.
![](https://astonmartin.sloththe.dev/isawesome/fae78b2c-972c-44df-bdab-ad9b7586b31c.png)

To get started, you would need to enter a domain into the text field, without the TLD at the end.

Once you have entered a domain name to check, you have the option of using 2 metrics to check, Soundex and Levenshtein. Both of these are explained if you click on the help icon to the right of the name.

Once you have selected the type and entered the similarity, you can go ahead and click the "Get Domains" button.

Once the results have loaded in, you can view the results, and sort by clicking on the title that you want to sort. The arrow will indicate whether the results are being sorted in ascending or descending order.

This is an example of data being sorted by Similarity in ascending order.
